#  DevCon 1993 

### September 1993 - Fort Lauderdale - Marriot Harbor Beach Hotel

I remember this DevCon as a lot of fun at a fantastic hotel. I think it was my first. The major topic was CDD 3.0, and its problems. There had been about 8 releases and it had finally stabilized. The welcome dinner had a little skit where various characters that caused the CDD problems had roles, like the Memory Manager.

I do not have the brochure, so if you have it please contract me. I scanned the Schedule to a PDF to give you an idea of the topics. I scanned a few session papers. Most are not of use any longer (e.g. DOS templates) or were just ruled pages for notes. David Bayliss did his first "Squeezing the Last Drop" session that was my favorite and was repeated at probably every DevCon.

I scanned Bob Butler's session paper on Vertical Market Software. This was his DOS Time Matters product. Bob was one of the first to have a Clarion Windows product and went on to great success. He did a presentation on the same topic a few years later for his Windows program that I do recall. 

The schedule shows that David Bayliss gave two talks on Clarion for Windows and a Preview. I can't recall any of that. There were no slides. I do recall the next year in Boca seeing CDDW 1.0 and getting a training session from Richard Taylor. At the PC next to me was Stamos. There was no Report template so you hand coded it.

The schedule lists a "Tacky Tourist Party" which I do recall as being so fun it motivated me to attend the next DevCon. It was in the large double ballroom and had stations around the room with fun stuff which I can only recall these:

* Man with Parrots to put on you and take a picture
* Palm Reader / Fortune Teller
* Caricature Artist doing Portraits
* Games to play and win Tacky Prizes
* Life Sized Rock-em Sock-em Robots - you strapped into your robot about 2 feet in front of you - Fun! 
* Beach Snacks: Cotton Candy, Snow Cones, Pretzels
