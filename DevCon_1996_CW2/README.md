#  DevCon 1996

### March 26-28, 1996 – Orlando – MCO Airport Hotel

TODO - this is not complete

These are my recollections, I could be wrong. Please contribute comments and corrections on the ClarionHub thread and I'll post here.

This was a memorable DevCon, mainly for being the worst in many ways (but not content or presenters). Also memorable for the phrase "press the Blue Fart button" heard in many interesting English accents, now banned from speaking and removed in C7. The hotel was above the MCO airport terminal, that was undesirable. Want to go for a walk around the terminal? I recall from my balcony having a perfect view of the people driving up to departures and dropping off.

For this show TopSpeed hired a show management company DCI(?), in the past it was managed by their internal person "Anuska?" that in hindsight was fantastic. In prior DevCon's there was a wonderful dinner the evening before served in courses at tables. This time DCI had a buffet of cheese, chips and veggies where we stood in line for sliced sandwiches of Turkey and Beef. There was a limit of one per trip.

Using DCI they hoped for much larger attendance, but that did not happen. While browsing the choices I overhead Bruce Barrington lamenting to Stamos "even with DCI we have like 305 attendees, the same as always, like its a universal constant or something, like PI". I like BB's analysis. One of the highlights of DevCon was BB speaking and getting to meet him.

The disappointment of the DCI manager slapped us in the face big time entering the main meeting room the first day of the conference. In the past we had a large double ballroom with tables to place materials and laptops that allowed two feet between us to spread out. The DCI room was half of a ballroom with just chairs smashed tight so we were touching shoulders.

The "fun event" was a trip to Sea World where we had a special event with food in the Penguin building. I had never been there and enjoyed seeing the whale and other shows. Free Willy! As always hanging out with other developers was the best thing.

Many of the best sessions did not come with slides so below I'll type a few notes...

## Wrap Up Q&A Session – Bruce Barrington

Always a highlight the final session was hearing the boss reveal some inside info about things that had happened we did not know about, and what was planned for the future.
