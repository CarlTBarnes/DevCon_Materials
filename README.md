#  DevCon Materials and other Clarion History

I attended a number of Clarion DevCon conferences and enojoyed them all. I regret the ones I skipped. The best part was meeting other Clarion Developers and the TopSpeed developers and staff. This continues on today with the CIDC events. Do NOT miss them!

In this Repo I'll try to collect scans of materials. I'll start with the Brochures I can find and gradually post them. If you have some materials please contact me so I can post them. 

There will be a thread on ClarionHub to discuss.
